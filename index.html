				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
            	<p id="homepage">I am a freshman and am pursuing a Bachelors of science computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. For around 6 years I have been messing around with everything computer and have been settling more on software engineering as a primary career for my future. I am mostly self-taught and CS remains a strong passion of mine, a broad spectrum of topics completely perplex me and I have done research venturing into several different fields. <br>Other than studying computer science, I enjoy water sports such as wakeboarding, jetskiing, and swimming as well as playing hockey, airsofting with friends, and playing PC games.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="homepage"> Feel free to check out the various tabs to see some of my projects that I have done and learn more about me.
